					<h2>3D Printing</h2>
					<p>3D printing (a.k.a Additive Manufacturing) is now pretty well established in industry as a prototyping tool, and is becoming more common as a process for creating finished custom or low-run parts.
						In the home, printers can be a marvelous tool for solving practical household problems for example by repairing items, or creating new items that are fully customised for their position or use case.</p>
					<h3>The process of 3D Printing</h3>
					<ol>
					<li><p>Get a digital 3D model (by downloading or making one)</p></li>
					<li><p>Slice it (use a program to generate instructions for the printer)</p></li>
					<li><p>Print it (and troubleshoot it)</p></li>
					<li><p>Post-process it (remove support material, clean up areas, paint etc)</p></li>
					</ol>

					<h3>Material Choices</h3>
					<p><p>When you are just starting out with FDM 3D printing PLA is the recommended choice. It&#39;s very easy to work, relatively strong, with and comes without many of the safety concerns of other materials.

					<h3>Slicer software</h3>
					<p>I will be using <a href="https://ultimaker.com/software/ultimaker-cura" rel="nofollow">Ultimaker Cura</a> which is a free, open source and highly customisable software for slicing of the 3D models to prepare them for printing.
						<h3>Type of printer</h3>
						<p>I will be mainly using the Ultimaker 2+ as it is the one that I'm familliar with.

						<h3>Printing out my designs</h3>
						<p>For the first design I've printed, it is the nametag which I designed. I printed it out using the skirt setting and normal infill.

						<p>For the second design, I printed it out with brim setting and normal infill and also with supports as I've realised that there are some overhang with the design.
