					  <h3>2D raster</h3>
						<p>Raster images, also known as bitmaps, are comprised of individual pixels of color.
							Each colour pixel contributes to the overall image.
							When viewed individually, its a colour; but when viewed as a whole, the coloured pixels make up a vivid and detailed image, which provides for rich details and pixel-by-pixel editing. They can be created in softwares such as Adobe Photoshop and GIMP.</p>

					  <h3>2D vector</h3>
						<p>Unlike raster graphics, which are comprised of colored pixels arranged to display an image, vector graphics are made up of paths, each with a mathematical formula (vector) that tells the path how it is shaped and what color it is bordered with or filled by.
						Since mathematical formulas dictate how the image is rendered, vector images retain their appearance regardless of size. They can be scaled infinitely. Vector images can be created and edited in programs such as Illustrator, CorelDraw, and InkScape.</p>
