					  <h2>Computer-Aided Design</h2>


					  <p><h3>2D raster</h3></p>
						<p>Raster images, also known as bitmaps, are comprised of individual pixels of color.
							Each colour pixel contributes to the overall image.
							When viewed individually, its a colour; but when viewed as a whole, the coloured pixels make up a vivid and detailed image, which provides for rich details and pixel-by-pixel editing. They can be created in softwares such as Adobe Photoshop and GIMP.</p>
							<p><img src="https://i.ibb.co/h7xLSBh/raster.jpg" width="500px"></p>
					  <h3>2D vector</h3>
						<p>Unlike raster graphics, which are comprised of colored pixels arranged to display an image, vector graphics are made up of paths, each with a mathematical formula (vector) that tells the path how it is shaped and what color it is bordered with or filled by.
						Since mathematical formulas dictate how the image is rendered, vector images retain their appearance regardless of size. They can be scaled infinitely. Vector images can be created and edited in programs such as Illustrator, CorelDraw, and InkScape.</p>

						<p><h2>Fusion 360?</h2>
						<p>Fusion 360 is a cloud-based CAD/CAM tool which allows the user to design anything.
							It combines organic shapes modelling, mechanical design and manufacturing in one comprehensive package.
						I will be using Fusion 360 for my designs.</p>
					  <h2>Assignment 1: Nametag</h2>
						<p>Firstly, I sketched out the nametag body on the x-y plane.
						<p><img src="https://i.ibb.co/pJjkCtq/Screenshot-3.png" width="500px"></p>
						<p>Secondly, I used the offset tool to create the outline around the body and used the circle tool for the ring on the nametag.
						<p><img src="https://i.ibb.co/cxdKvfF/Screenshot-4.png" width="500px"></p>
						<p>Lastly, I finished the nametag off with the extrude tool.
						<p><img src="https://i.ibb.co/R6JvQSc/Screenshot-5.png" width="500px"></p>
						<h2> Assignment 2: Fidget Spinner</h2>
						<p>Firstly, I sketched out the layout of how big I wanted my fidget spinner to be, including the middle area using just the circle tool and the offset tool.
						<p><img src="https://i.ibb.co/JnDYmLB/Screenshot-6.png" width="500px"></p>
						<p>Secondly, I drew out one part of the fidget spinner and used the circular copy tool to copy out the other 2 parts.
						<p><img src="https://i.ibb.co/88mhW2P/Screenshot-7.png" width="500px"></p>
						<p>Lastly, I used the trim tool to remove the excess lines and extruded the fidget spinner design.
						<p><img src="https://i.ibb.co/2t8crs0/Screenshot-8.png" width="500px"></p>
						<p>I've also managed to create the M8 nuts that I will be using for my fidget spinner.
						<p><img src="https://i.ibb.co/NY8ntPB/Screenshot-9.png" width="500px"></p>
						<h2>Assignment 3: Chess Pawn</h2>
						<p>Firstly, I inserted the canvas of the chess pawn using insert canvas.
						<p><img src="https://i.ibb.co/nzfR68P/Screenshot-28.png" width="500px"></p>
						<p>Secondly, I used the line tool and the spline tool to outline half of the chess pawn.
						<p><img src="https://i.ibb.co/8XdTBh3/Screenshot-31.png" width="500px"></p>
						<p>Next, I used the revolve tool to revolve the one-half outline of the pawn and set it to 360 degree so that it would become a 3D model.
						<p><img src="https://i.ibb.co/PM8RyjD/Screenshot-32.png" width="500px"></p>
						<p><img src="https://i.ibb.co/QNX1L8c/Screenshot-34.png" width="500px"></p>
						<h2>Ball in a cube</h2>
						<p>This design was quite simple. All I had to do was to draw out the design of the outer cube first and then followed by the ball in the middle.
